## Introduction

DHT implements the bittorrent DHT protocol in Go. Now it includes:

- [BEP-3 (part)](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html)
- [BEP-5](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html)
- [BEP-9](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html)
- [BEP-10](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html)

It contains two modes, the standard mode and the crawling mode. The standard
mode follows the BEPs, and you can use it as a standard dht server. The crawling
mode aims to crawl as more metadata info as possiple. It doesn't follow the
standard BEPs protocol. With the crawling mode, you can build another [BTDigg](http://btdigg.org/).

## Installation

    go get github.com/MildC/dht-crawler/dht

## Example

Below is a simple spider. You can move [here](https://github.com/MildC/dht-crawler/blob/master/sample)
to see more samples.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/shiyanhui/dht"
)

func main() {
    downloader := dht.NewWire(65535)
    go func() {
        // once we got the request result
        for resp := range downloader.Response() {
            fmt.Println(resp.InfoHash, resp.MetadataInfo)
        }
    }()
    go downloader.Run()

    config := dht.NewCrawlConfig()
    config.OnAnnouncePeer = func(infoHash, ip string, port int) {
        // request to download the metadata info
        downloader.Request([]byte(infoHash), ip, port)
    }
    d := dht.New(config)

    d.Run()
}
```

## Note

- The default crawl mode configure costs about 300M RAM. Set **MaxNodes**
  and **BlackListMaxSize** to fit yourself.
- Now it cant't run in LAN because of NAT.

## TODO

- [ ] NAT Traversal.
- [ ] Implements the full BEP-3.
- [ ] Optimization.

## FAQ

#### Why it is slow compared to other spiders ?

Well, maybe there are several reasons.

- DHT aims to implements the standard BitTorrent DHT protocol, not born for crawling the DHT network.
- NAT Traversal issue. You run the crawler in a local network.
- It will block ip which looks like bad and a good ip may be mis-judged.
